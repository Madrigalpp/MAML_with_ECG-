# Using maml method combine with light weight CNN to Realize portable ECG devices
## Acknowledgements
Thanks to MIT_BIH data, we using these data for our **data support** , combine with AD 8232 (Adruino uno) data we dectected, we can classify the ECG in short time   
In this article, I completed the Light-Maml code to implement few shot learning for ECG classificationï¼š [Few shot learning on ECG Light-Weight Detection](www.google.com)(under writting right now)  
##  Overview
you can use the project directly as the sequence of my code block in google colab
##  Data-available
you should download from MIT-BIH data: [mit-bih](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)
